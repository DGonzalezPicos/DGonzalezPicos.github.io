# âœ… WORKING: Isotope Ratios Submission System

## Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL ðŸš€

Your isotope ratios submission system is now **working perfectly** with proper port separation!

## Port Configuration âœ…

### Port 8000: Your Main HTML Site
- **Purpose**: Live development and viewing your HTML site
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/isotope_ratios.html`
- **Status**: Keep this running as you normally do for live changes

### Port 5000: Flask Submission System
- **Purpose**: Handles form submissions and admin interface
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5000` (submission backend)
- **Admin**: `http://localhost:5000/admin.html`
- **Status**: âœ… Currently running and working!

## How to Use

### 1. For Daily Development (HTML changes):
```bash
# Your existing workflow - keep using port 8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
# View at: http://localhost:8000/isotope_ratios.html
```

### 2. For Submission System:
```bash
# First, activate your conda environment
prt3

# Then start the submission server
cd /home/picos/public_html
python3 submission_server.py &

# Or use the script:
./start_submissions.sh
```

### 3. For Users Submitting Measurements:
- They visit: `http://localhost:8000/isotope_ratios.html` (your main site)
- When they submit forms, it connects to port 5000 (Flask backend)
- Submissions are stored in CSV files for your review

### 4. For You to Review Submissions:
- Visit: `http://localhost:5000/admin.html`
- Review, approve, or reject submissions
- Approved data goes to `data/approved_measurements.csv`

## File Overview

### Core Files:
- `isotope_ratios.html` - Your main page with submission form âœ…
- `submission_server.py` - Flask backend (port 5000) âœ…
- `admin.html` - Admin interface for reviewing submissions âœ…

### Data Files (auto-created):
- `data/pending_submissions.csv` - New submissions awaiting review
- `data/approved_measurements.csv` - Approved measurements ready for integration

### Startup Scripts:
- `start_submissions.sh` - Start the Flask submission server

## Server Management Commands

```bash
# Check if submission server is running
python3 -c "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:5000/api/status').read().decode())"

# Stop submission server
pkill -f submission_server.py

# Start submission server (in prt3 environment)
prt3 && python3 submission_server.py &
```

## What's Working Now âœ…

1. **HTML Site**: Port 8000 for live development
2. **Submission Forms**: Port 5000 Flask backend
3. **Admin Interface**: Review and approve submissions
4. **Data Storage**: CSV files for easy integration
5. **DOI Support**: Added DOI field as requested
6. **Email Fallback**: Works if Flask server is down

## Integration Workflow

1. **Users submit** via your HTML site (port 8000)
2. **Forms connect** to Flask backend (port 5000)
3. **You review** submissions in admin panel
4. **Approved data** goes to CSV files
5. **You integrate** approved data into your main database

## Next Steps (Optional)

- **Auto-start**: Add submission server to your startup scripts
- **Email notifications**: Configure email alerts for new submissions
- **Data integration**: Create scripts to automatically update your HTML table from approved CSV data

---

**Your system is now production-ready!** Users can submit measurements, and you have full control over the review and approval process. Both servers can run simultaneously without conflicts.
